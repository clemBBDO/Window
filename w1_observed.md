		<p>Every day, culture is captured in the uploading of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. Some of this can be given structure and analysed, to tell us how culture is being created and how itâ€™s being experienced.</p>
		<p>We monitor and analyse all the major news outlets, critical subreddits, Twitter, and Instagram. All as standard. Each client category has its own intricacies, and we tailor our recordings for them. This might mean analysing industry press, or particular subreddits. We also draw on the power of other cultural monitoring tools, like AustraliaNOW, to further our coverage.</p>
		<p>All these components are built in to custom webapps for interaction by any and all that want to undertake first-step analysis. For more complicated requests, our data science team are always happy to take a deeper dive.</p>
